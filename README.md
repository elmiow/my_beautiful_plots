# README -- my_beautiful_plots

## I love to tell interesting stories from robust statistical analysis & well designed graphs and maps. I present here a general overview of outcomes for which I have written the code myself. 

## Further, I give two examples of code that lead to beautiful plots and worldmaps. Please note that all code presented here are only extracts from original scripts. 
## Each code example refers to its own beautiful plot uploaded in the repository. Self-explanatory, I guess. 

## Apart from producing plots and graphs, I am very experienced in writing clear functions and loops to treat and calculate with huge amounts of input data. 
## Skilled in data cleaning and preparation, multivariate and nonlinear statistical model building, machine learning techniques, e.g. multivariate regression analysis or cluster algorithms.
